# What it is
Fork of comic-shanns (https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns), without discrimination in the README against diacritics and removing the hideous serif from the "f" character.

## How was it made?
The TTF was edited in fontforge to adjust the "f" glyph, and from that new TTF and OTF were generated. The new fonts were placed in v2-2 folder. Original was kept in v2 for reference.

## If you hate the serif so much, why not remove it from other glyphs such as "i" and "l"?
My goal is to use this font together with my other project, https://github.com/caioycosta/comic-fork-mono-font , in order to have a comic-like font for programming. `i`, `I`, `l`, and `1` are common pain-points with such fonts and as such, the serifs have a reason for being there -- which isn't the case with the "f" glyph.

## Any other suggestions
File an issue and I'll (sometime) look into it. Beware that approval will be subject to my personal design preferences.
