# What it is
Fork of comic-mono-font (https://github.com/dtinth/comic-mono-font), updated with better metrics and for a custom build of comic-shanns, featuring diacritics and no serif on the "f" glyph, and generation script updated for Python 3.

## Any suggestions
File an issue and I'll (sometime) look into it. Beware that approval will be subject to my personal design preferences.
